## Binary Protocol and Hardware Reference

Sources: [protocol.py](../src/services/io_board/protocol.py), [io_types.py](../src/services/io_board/io_types.py), [코맨드 요청 및 응답](../specs/%EC%BD%94%EB%A7%A8%EB%93%9C_%EC%9A%94%EC%B2%AD_%EB%B0%8F_%EC%9D%91%EB%8B%B5.csv), [코맨드 종류](../specs/%EC%BD%94%EB%A7%A8%EB%93%9C_%EC%A2%85%EB%A5%98.csv), [통신사양서](../specs/%ED%86%B5%EC%8B%A0%EC%82%AC%EC%96%91%EC%84%9C.csv).

### Physical/Link Layer
- Interface: RS-232C async, 38,400 bps, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit (8N1).
- Timing: start/stop bits per standard; device may toggle deadbolt briefly on init per CSV.

### Frame Layout
- Bytes: `[STX][CMD][SUBCMD][DATA...][ETX][LRC]`
- STX: 0x02; ETX: 0x03.
- CMD/SUBCMD: 2 ASCII chars each.
- DATA: command-specific, see tables.
- LRC/Checksum: XOR of all bytes between STX (exclusive) and ETX (exclusive).

### Command Matrix (MC management/control)

| CMD | SUBCMD | Meaning | DATA (tx/rx) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MC | PD | Initialize | none/none | Sent at power-on; device may pulse deadbolt 0.5s for init. |
| MC | DC | Door/deadbolt control | `DOOR` 1 byte (`O` or `C`) / same echoed | Used for deadbolt open/close; RS232 spec notes O=open 0V, C=close. |
| MC | LZ | Calibrate loadcells | none/none | Forces zeroing all loadcells. |
| MC | WP | Write manufacturing ID | 11 ASCII (e.g., `P1234567890`) / echoed | Stored on board. |
| MC | EZ | Clear error history | none/none | Clears 4-slot error log. |
| MC | RT | Reset via relay | none/none | Power-reset PC and SMPS (fridge excluded) per spec note. |

### Request Matrix (RQ data queries)

| CMD | SUBCMD | Meaning | Response DATA | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RQ | MI | Manufacturing info | PRODUCT_ID (11 ASCII) + SW_VERSION (2 ASCII) | Sent at power-on by host per CSV. |
| RQ | IW | Loadcell weights | 10 readings × 6 ASCII chars | Range -40000..+40000 per spec; error codes `EEEEEE` (no comms) / `VVVVVV` (out of range). |
| RQ | ID | IO status | DOOR (6 ASCII) + DEADBOLT (6 ASCII) | Values like `CLOSED`/`OPENED`; deadbolt sensed by magnet. |
| RQ | ER | Error history | 4 error codes × 4 ASCII | Codes include DB01 (open fail), DB02 (close fail), LC01–LC10 (loadcell comms/range), `0000` for empty; FIFO of last four. |

### Field Formats
- Manufacturing/product ID: 11 ASCII characters (e.g., `P1234567890`).
- Loadcell reading: 6 ASCII characters. Integer firmware: sign + five digits, e.g., `+01234`, `-40000`. Fractional firmware (sensor resolution 0.1): sign + `XXX.X`, e.g., `+123.4`, `-079.5` — decimal only fits for |value| < 1000; larger values fall back to integer form. Errors `EEEEEE`, `VVVVVV`; practical range 0–40000 g in spec though code allows larger format. Host software parses both forms transparently and preserves one decimal in filtered output.
- Door/deadbolt state: 6-char strings, typically `CLOSED`, `OPENED`, `LOCKED`/`OPENED` per CSV; code treats as opaque 6-char.
- Errors: 4-char codes; empty slots `0000`.

### Checksums and Validation
- Builder: `build_request()` assembles Construct frame and XOR checksum.
- Parser: `parse_response()` validates STX/ETX and checksum; errors surface as `ErrorCode.PROTOCOL_CHECKSUM_MISMATCH`, `PROTOCOL_MALFORMED_DATA`, or `PROTOCOL_PARSE_FAILED` with hex context.

### Mismatches/Notes
- Code uses LRC term “checksum” as XOR; matches CSV.
- REST/SSE schema는 실행 중인 서비스의 `/docs`와 `/openapi.json`을 기준으로 한다.
- Loadcell value clamp/formatting for filters uses +/- five digits; aligns with hardware range.
- A response mismatch remains unresolved: the board/serial path can return the
  previous command's complete, checksum-valid response (`RQ/IW` and `RQ/ID`
  have been observed exchanged). This can delay or fail deadbolt verification
  and is a suspected contributor to loadcell raw SSE anomalies. See
  [KNOWN_RESPONSE_MISMATCH.md](KNOWN_RESPONSE_MISMATCH.md) and issue #3.

### Error Code Meanings (device level from CSV)
- DB01: command to unlock but remains locked.
- DB02: command to lock but remains unlocked.
- LC01–LC10: loadcell comms failure or weight range exceeded per sensor.
- Additional device codes may be vendor-specific; `0000` means no error.

### Health-check policy for RQER
- `RQER` is a timestamp-free FIFO history, not a snapshot of currently active
  faults. Without first issuing the destructive `MCEZ`, it cannot distinguish
  a stale recovered fault from a current fault.
- `GET /health` therefore does not issue `RQER` or `MCEZ`. Current loadcell
  health is derived from the current `RQIW` frame; current deadbolt health is
  derived from `RQID` plus the tracked result of the most recent control
  request.
- Raw error history remains available through `GET /errors`. Clearing it is an
  explicit operator action through `DELETE /errors`, never a health-check side
  effect.
- A future active diagnostic may use `MCEZ -> controlled action -> settle ->
  RQID/RQER`, but must serialize with normal deadbolt operations and preserve
  or report its diagnostic context.

### Reference Implementation Pointers
